# Learn-PySpark
These notebooks I have taken from two different sources practise PySpark. 
- For the start you can go through this fantastic [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/EB8lfdxpirM) by Code2j where he also explains the entire [notebook](https://github.com/MaulikSoni-97/Learn-PySpark/blob/main/Basics/pyspark.ipynb) with theory.
- Later you can pull the [repo](https://github.com/andfanilo/pyspark-tutorial) and practise the exercise in jupyter notebooks and if need a help then you can go thrugh my solutions [RDDs](https://github.com/MaulikSoni-97/Learn-PySpark/tree/main/RDDs) and [SparkSQL](https://github.com/MaulikSoni-97/Learn-PySpark/tree/main/SparkSQL) for the same.
